## How to verify the latest drivers yourself

Instead of trusting other driver updaters (even the official Intel Driver & Support Assistant) that often suggest old versions, you can easily check the **true latest driver version** for any Intel Wi‑Fi or Bluetooth device manually. Here’s how:

---

### Step‑by‑step (pick one or more wireless devices)

#### 1. Open Device Manager  
Choose one of the following methods:
- Press **Win key + X** → **Device Manager**
- Press **Win key**, type `Device Manager` and press Enter
- Press **Win key + R**, type `devmgmt.msc` and press Enter

---

#### 2. Find an Intel Wi‑Fi or Intel Bluetooth device
- Expand the **“Network adapters”** section for Wi‑Fi devices, or **“Bluetooth”** section for Bluetooth devices.
- Look for any entry with **“Intel(R) Wi‑Fi”** or **“Intel(R) Wireless Bluetooth(R)”** in its name.
- Often the name already contains the hardware model – for example: `Intel(R) Wi‑Fi 7 BE200 320MHz`.

#### 3. Find the exact Hardware ID (DEV_ or PID_ in the Hardware IDs property
- Right‑click the device → **Properties** → **Details** tab, then:
- In the **Property** dropdown, select **“Hardware Ids”**.

You will see something like: `PCI\VEN_8086&DEV_272B&CC_0280` for Wi‑Fi or `USB\VID_8087&PID_0036` for Bluetooth.  
The part after **`DEV_`** (here **`272B`**) or **`PID_`** (here **`0036`**) is the most important identifier.

---

#### 4. Look up the device in the databases I maintain on GitHub
Open the database in your browser, and you will immediately see the latest driver version and release date.

### **[Intel Wi-Fi Drivers Latest](https://github.com/FirstEverTech/Universal-Intel-WiFi-BT-Updater/blob/main/data/intel-wifi-driver-latest.md)**

### **[Intel Wireless Bluetooth Drivers Latest](https://github.com/FirstEverTech/Universal-Intel-WiFi-BT-Updater/blob/main/data/intel-bt-driver-latest.md)**

Search for your device to make sure it is on the list of models supported by this driver (e.g. `272B` or `0036`).
> **Note:** If your device is very old or no longer supported by Intel, it may not appear in these databases.


---

#### 5. Compare with what your driver tool says
If another program does not see the latest version or suggests a downgrade to an older version, that is not correct.
The **[Universal Intel Wi‑Fi and Bluetooth Drivers Updater](https://github.com/FirstEverTech/Universal-Intel-WiFi-BT-Updater)** tool will **automatically** check for all your Intel wireless devices in seconds, then download and install the correct packages with full hash verification.
