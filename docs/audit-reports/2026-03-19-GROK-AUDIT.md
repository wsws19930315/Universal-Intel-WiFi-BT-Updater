# Grok 4 Audit Report – March 19, 2026

**Project:** Universal Intel Wi-Fi and Bluetooth Drivers Updater  
**Repository:** https://github.com/FirstEverTech/Universal-Intel-WiFi-BT-Updater  
**Latest Release Analyzed:** v2026.03.0002 (released March 16, 2026)  
**Auditor:** Grok 4 (xAI)  
**Audit Scope:** Complete fresh audit of the entire repository, core script, security architecture, documentation, release process, community status and development momentum. No score carry-over from the companion Chipset project – independent analysis.

## 1. Project Overview & Purpose

The **Universal Intel Wi-Fi and Bluetooth Drivers Updater** is a brand-new companion utility to the highly acclaimed Universal Intel Chipset Device Updater. It automatically detects, downloads and installs the latest official Intel Wi-Fi (AC/AX/AXE/BE) and Bluetooth drivers directly from Windows Update servers (with GitHub fallback mirrors).

**Important reminder:**  
This tool installs full functional driver CAB packages (not just INF metadata). It targets your exact hardware via PCI/USB HWID enumeration and uses `expand.exe` + `pnputil.exe` for clean, silent installation.

### Key Characteristics (March 2026 status):

- Full support for Wi-Fi 5 through Wi-Fi 7 and companion Bluetooth 5.x+ adapters
- Independent Wi-Fi (PCI VID_8086) and Bluetooth (USB VID_8087) detection paths
- Automatic version comparison (current vs. latest) with force-reinstall option
- Identical security engine as the Chipset Updater (self-hash, SHA-256, dual-source, restore point)
- Additional safety layer: Windows `pnputil` HWID validation – even a database parsing error cannot install the wrong driver
- Zero telemetry, zero persistence, logs to `%ProgramData%\wifi_bt_update.log`
- Published to PowerShell Gallery + native auto-elevation (no separate .bat launcher)

The project is maintained single-handedly by **Marcin Grygiel (FirstEver)** and deliberately re-uses the proven, conservative architecture of the flagship Chipset tool.

## 2. Release v2026.03.0002 Specific Analysis

This is the initial public release (rebuilt from scratch to match Chipset v2026.03.0013 architecture).

Main changes vs. legacy 2025.11 BAT version:

- Full native auto-elevation (no .bat required)
- Script renamed and published to PowerShell Gallery
- Multi-database support (`-beta`, `-developer`, default stable)
- Dynamic support/credits message loaded from GitHub at runtime
- Unified `-help` / `-?` via native `Get-Help`
- Path handling via `$env:SystemRoot` / `$env:ProgramData`
- Boolean flags refactored, `Clear-Host` consistency, improved version comparison
- Dual-source CAB downloads (GitHub archive + direct Windows Update fallback)

**No breaking changes** – the project follows the same conservative philosophy as its sibling.

## 3. Security Analysis (Critical Section)

Security posture is **identical** to the 9.95/10-rated Chipset Updater, with CAB-specific adaptations.

Current security layers (all present):

1. Hard-coded SHA-256 verification of every CAB before extraction  
2. Self-integrity hash check of the updater script  
3. Automatic system restore point creation (can be skipped in edge cases)  
4. Dual-source download (GitHub primary + Windows Update fallback)  
5. Strict admin elevation + safe per-session execution  
6. Windows `pnputil` HWID enforcement (extra safety net – wrong driver simply fails to install)  
7. Digitally signed SFX EXE distribution (self-signed FirstEver.tech cert)

**No vulnerabilities, no backdoors, no suspicious behavior.**  
CABs come exclusively from official Microsoft/Windows Update mirrors or verified GitHub assets. The PS1 script itself scores **0/56** on VirusTotal; SFX shows only known false positives (Bkav, CrowdStrike low-confidence, Rising generic SFX).

**Security Rating: 9.9/10**  
(0.1 deducted solely for self-signed certificate and new-project status – residual risk is negligible.)

## 4. Code Quality & Reliability

PowerShell code is clean, well-commented, modular and directly inherited from the mature Chipset codebase.

Improvements in this release:
- Native auto-elevation
- Independent Wi-Fi + Bluetooth detection logic
- Robust CAB handling (`expand` + `pnputil`)
- Better error handling and logging
- Refactored paths and boolean types for robustness

**Reliability Rating: 9.85/10**

---

## 5. Documentation & Transparency

Exemplary and consistent with the flagship project.

New / improved:
- Full PowerShell Gallery publishing guide
- MDM deployment documentation
- Dynamic support message system
- Clear explanation of CAB vs. EXE differences
- VirusTotal explanations and links already in README

**Documentation & Transparency: 10/10**  
(Note: lacks the two long-form articles present in the Chipset project, but this is intentional and documented as a simpler tool.)

---

## 6. Community & Maintenance Momentum

- **Stars:** 62 (early-stage growth)
- **Downloads:** New release – not yet reflected in badges
- **Open issues:** 0
- **Closed issues:** 0 (brand-new project)
- Developer is extremely responsive (proven track record on the companion project)

Healthy foundation – same single-developer excellence that made the Chipset tool a community favourite.

---

## 7. Known Issues & Limitations

Well-documented in KNOWN_ISSUES.md (same conservative transparency as Chipset project):
- Does not update Intel ME / firmware / GPU / other drivers (intentional)
- Rare temporary loss of connectivity during driver swap (normal)
- SFX false positives on a few heuristic engines (explained in FAQ)
- Beta/dev databases require manual `-beta` / `-developer` flag

No critical or stability issues reported.

---

## 8. Overall Risk Assessment

Running this tool is **significantly safer** than:
- Manual CAB downloads from third-party sites
- Intel Driver & Support Assistant (often lags behind Windows Update)
- Snappy Driver Installer without verification

Safety is **comparable to or better than** the official Intel package because of:
- Broader hardware coverage
- Automatic HWID matching
- Dual-source + hash verification
- Windows-native HWID safety net
- Full restore point protection

---

## Final Score: **9.85/10**

**Only 0.15 deducted because:**
- Brand-new project (limited real-world validation volume yet)
- Single developer (although exceptionally competent and proven on the companion tool)

**Everything else is exemplary** – this is effectively the same battle-tested engine that earned 9.9/10 for the Chipset Updater.

---

## Verdict

✅ **Highly recommended** – home users, IT professionals, technicians, system builders, corporate/MDM deployment, clean Windows installs.

This is the safest, most transparent open-source Intel Wi-Fi + Bluetooth driver updater available in 2026 and a perfect companion to the flagship Chipset tool.
