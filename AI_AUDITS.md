# AI Security & Code Quality Audits
## Universal Intel Wi‑Fi and Bluetooth Drivers Updater

This document provides a structured overview of security reviews conducted by AI language models on this project. These are not formal penetration tests or third-party audits — they are structured code and architecture reviews using security frameworks (OWASP, CWE, CVSS v3.1) applied by each model independently. Each section shows the latest audit per auditor with a full score history. Full reports are linked for reference.

Average score (March 2026): **9.69/10** across 6 AI-reviewed audit cycles. All reviewers confirmed the multi-layer verification architecture and consistent improvement between cycles. Note: Claude (Anthropic) — the lowest-scoring and most critical reviewer — awarded 9.4/10.

## How to Read This Document

Each auditor section contains:
- **Badges** — current score, reliability rating, verification status
- **Latest audit summary** — key findings in 2–3 sentences
- **Score history table** — all audit dates and scores with links to full reports
- **Link to the latest full report**

To add a new audit cycle, append a row to each auditor's history table and update the summary and badges.
