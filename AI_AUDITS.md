# AI Security & Code Quality Audits
## Universal Intel Wi‑Fi and Bluetooth Drivers Updater

This document provides a structured overview of security reviews conducted by AI language models on this project. These are not formal penetration tests or third-party audits — they are structured code and architecture reviews using security frameworks (OWASP, CWE, CVSS v3.1) applied by each model independently. Each section shows the latest audit per auditor with a full score history. Full reports are linked for reference.

Average score (March 2026): 9.5/10 across 6 AI-reviewed audit cycles. All reviewers confirmed the multi-layer verification architecture and consistent improvement between cycles. Note: Claude (Anthropic) — the lowest-scoring and most critical reviewer — awarded 8.7/10. <!-- after four audit cycles starting from x.x/10. -->

## How to Read This Document

Each auditor section contains:
- **Badges** — current score, reliability rating, verification status
- **Latest audit summary** — key findings in 2–3 sentences
- **Score history table** — all audit dates and scores with links to full reports
- **Link to the latest full report**

To add a new audit cycle, append a row to each auditor's history table and update the summary and badges.

**Latest audit:** March 19, 2026 · v2026.03.0002 · Score: **8.7/10**

- **Strengths:** Strong hardware detection, dual‑source fallback, clean code, clear UI.
- **Deductions:** **Errata:** three false‑positive bugs retracted; explicit Intel signature pre‑check missing (partially mitigated by `pnputil`); v1.0 track‑record penalty.
- **Verdict:** "A clean, architecturally sound v1.0 that inherits the best of a mature sibling project."

- Code quality, PowerShell best practices, and maintainability
- Download and installation pipeline integrity (hash verification, digital signatures)
- Error handling, logging, and reliability
- Documentation quality and transparency
- Real-world deployment metrics and issue tracker analysis

---

## Overall Assessment

The **Universal Intel Wi‑Fi and Bluetooth Drivers Updater** successfully inherits the battle‑tested security engine of its companion chipset tool and adapts it to the wireless driver domain.  
With **near‑perfect scores from multiple independent AI auditors**, it stands as one of the most secure, transparent, and professionally built driver automation tools available today.

✅ Safe for home users  
✅ Ready for IT professionals and MDM deployments  
✅ Significantly safer than manual downloads or generic driver updaters
